# Concepts

Get a basic understanding of Flows so you can setup your projects and start using Flows effectively.

## Basic Concepts

### Organization

An organization groups together all the projects and users in your company. It's the top-level entity in Flows. Here you manage your billing, users, and projects. As a user, you can be a member of multiple organizations and can switch between these organizations using a dropdown in the top right-hand corner of the application. When you are logging into Flows you are logging into your personal account.

### Project

An organization can have multiple projects. Projects typically represent a single application or a set of related applications. Each project has its own set of flows, analytics, and settings. Flows are always installed on per Project basis and all users can (theoretically) see all flows in the project.

### Flows

The most basic concept in Flows is the flow. A flow is a sequence of steps that a user can take to complete a task. Flows are created using the Flows Cloud editor and can be launched on a project's domain. Alternatively, you can define flows inside your codebase using the Flows SDK.

### Flow Step

Flow steps are the building blocks of a flow. They are the individual steps a user can take when interacting with your flow. There are multiple types of flow steps, such as [Tooltip](/step-types/tooltip), [Modal](/step-types/modal), [Wait](/step-types/wait), and [Fork](/step-types/fork). Each flow step has its own set of properties and settings.

## Cloud vs Local

Flows can be created and managed in two different ways: Cloud and Local.

**Cloud flows** are created and managed using the Flows Cloud editor. This approach is no-code, meaning you just need to add a code snippet to your application and the rest is managed in the Flows Cloud. This approach is great for quick iterations and non-technical users.

**Local flows** are defined inside your codebase using the Flows SDK. This approach gives your flows more stability and control, but requires more development effort. This approach is great for complex solutions and technical users.
